1. a) I think the bar chart is an effective visualization for this data. It 
    successfully contextualizes the percentages by displaying them next to 
    each other, communicating to the viewer that the percentages are
    very similar across all sexes.

   b) The line chart is an effective visualization for this data. It implements
    color to clearly contrast those with minimum bachelor degrees versus
    minimum high school degrees. The line is also effective for seeing the
    small changes in percentage from year to year.

2. There are several limitations of this data. Most obvious, there is a large
    amount of data missing, especially documenting people's races. This makes
    it difficult to get a clear picture of the change in degree attainment of
    any given race over a period of time. 

3. One potential ethical problem is the dataset's strict use of Male/Female/All
    sexes when there has been an increasing rise in individuals who identify as
    Transgender. Continuing to make generalizations off of data that does not 
    include a growing category of people could raise ethical concerns. Another
    potential ethical problem would arise from not contexualizing the data with
    historical events. For example, if someone made conclusions about the 
    percentage of African Americans/women attaining degrees in the early
    twentieth century when their rights were severely limited, this would be
    unethical.
